NeoDB is a free and open source integrated M.tuberculosis ‘omics’ knowledge-base. NeoDB is based on Neo4j and enables researchers to execute complex federated queries by linking well-known, curated and widely used biological data resources, and supplementary TB variants data from published literature.

## Motivation

Computational approaches in recent years have allowed biology researchers to discover, store, and share a large amount data via a number of heterogeneous publicly available biological data resources. Despite the usefulness of these resources, fragmented curation negatively impacts the researchers’ ability to leverage the data via federated queries.
