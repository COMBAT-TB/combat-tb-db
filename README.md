**[Combat-TB](https://combattb.org/)-NeoDB: fostering Tuberculosis research through integrative analysis using graph database technologies.**

[Combat-TB](https://combattb.org/)-NeoDB is an integrated _M.tuberculosis (M.tb)_ ‘omics’ knowledge-base. NeoDB is based on Neo4j and enables researchers to execute complex federated queries by linking well-known, curated and widely used _M.tb_ data resources, and supplementary Tuberculosis variants data from published literature. [Combat-TB](https://combattb.org/)-NeoDB was created by binding the labeled property graph model to a consensus-controlled ontology.

**A publicly accessible instance is available at**: [https://neodb.sanbi.ac.za](https://neodb.sanbi.ac.za)

## Purpose

To enable _M.tb_ researchers to execute *ad hoc* complex federated queries with the
ability to explore data interactively by linking well-known, curated and widely used _M.tb_ data resources, and supplementary TB variants data from published literature.

## Installation

To avoid the trouble of environment setup,
[running the database in a Docker container](https://combattb.org/combat-tb-neodb/installation/#using-docker) is highly recommended.

Otherwise, a manual installation guide can be found [here](https://combattb.org/combat-tb-neodb/installation/#standalone).
